Boxee allows you to create applications to extend its content and functionality. Whether it's local or web-based we hope you'll turn Boxee into exactly what you've always wanted in a media center (and share it with the rest of us!).

In addition to applications we maintain and manage a massive TV Show and Movie library with thousands of titles for your viewing pleasure. We encourage content owners to add their library to ours and expand your reach to well over a million Boxee users.

With all this in mind we've put together this wiki to help you get started building applications or helping to expand the Boxee library. If you've got questions please feel free to search our forums. Applications can be downloaded and installed from the Boxee Application Directory or from 3rd party repositories using the Boxee client from the Application menu.
