libbluray is a cross-platform library enabling playback of protected Bluray discs.

This project exists to:

Facilitate interoperability - allowing PLAYBACK of ORIGINAL and LEGAL bluray discs using legitimate BLURAY drives on platforms of YOUR CHOICE!

This project is NOT to be used for:

Copying Bluray discs and stipping bluray media of their content protection systems.
You have NO PERMISSION from the developers of this project to do so.

You must ONLY make use of this PROJECT if you agree with the above!

A person who bought a legal Bluray disc and paid for a legal bluray drive has no ability - until now - to play their legitimate
discs on an operating system of their choice. There are forced to use Windows-based players that either come with their drives 
or have to shell out $$$ for other Windows players. This is UNFAIR. This project exists to address that and give a user CHOICE.
