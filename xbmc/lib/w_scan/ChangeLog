ChangeLog:
--------------------

2011-05-02
 - fix wrong ATSC 8VSB and 16VSB identifiers for xine output, thanks to M.Krufky
 - now assume country = US, if frontend type = ATSC. This should work, since
   most non-US countries using ATSC still use the same channel lists as US.
 - now assume vdr format vdr-1.7, if VSB/QAM-B scan with vdr settings.
   ATSC users of VDR anyway need to patch their sources or upgrade to
   latest developer releases.
 - check if choosen frontend type fits to choosen scan type
 - extend -a option to allow string /dev/dvb/adapterN/frontendM
   you may now use -a (0..7) or -a /dev/dvb/adapter(0..7)/frontend(0..7)

2011-04-10
 - fix qam setting BR
 - add option -C <charset>, output coding (default: guess users codepage).
   if given, w_scan uses iconv to translate to this charset,
    i.e. 'w_scan -fc -cDE -C utf-8'
   if not given, w_scan tries to *guess* your charset and translates to that.
 - now guess users country if -c <country> not given.
 - add compiler flags: Wall, Wextra, Wno-comment, Wswitch-default, Wno-unused-parameter
 - remove all remaining <TAB> whitespaces.

2011-03-29
 - add Brasil ISDB-T/DVB-C, thanks to Mauro Carvalho Chehab
 - changed command line option '-S':
   - ordering of srates
   - add 6086
   - add 5217
   - remove 7000, because unreasonable
 - update man page accordingly 
 - update S23E5 TP16

2011-03-13
 - update S41E9 and rename to S42E0

2011-03-06
 - NOTE@maintainers: it's called 'w_scan', not 'w-scan' or 'wscan'.<br>
   Please fix if mistyped in your repo.
 - fix memory leak in parse-dvbscan.c:142 (dvbscan_parse_tuningdata; char * buf)
 - fix memory leak in parse-dvbscan.c:489 (dvbscan_parse_rotor_positions; char * buf)
 - fix double deallocating pointer in scan.c:2999 (main; int frontend_fd)
 - fix memory leak in scan.c:2654 (main; char * country)
 - fix memory leak in scan.c:2722 (main; char * satellite)
 - fix memory leak in scan.c:3192 (main; char * initdata)
 - remove unused videodev.h from countries.c. Thanks to Felix Kaechele. 
 - fix octals in countries.c (backport from vdr-plugin wirbelscan-0.0.7)
 - check/report hardware frequency and symbolrate limits to avoid error
   messages in syslog
 - fix option -L (VLC output) in case of DVB-S. Thanks to Juergen Lock.

2011-02-06
 - bugfix: fix wrong comparison in check_frontend(), which lets the caller assume
   that to not yet have pll lock and wait until timeout is over. This may speed up
   each tuning to a new transponder a little. Thanks to Dick Streefland. 
 - set PILOT_AUTO on satellite transponders found by NIT. There's no flag inside NIT
   to find explicitly 'ON' or 'OFF', so AUTO is the very best approach here.
   Thanks to Dick Streefland.
 - change <TAB> to <SPACE> in satellites.{c,h} and countries.{c.h} for better compat
   with wirbelscan-0.0.6.
 - add channel identifier USERLIST to channellist_t for compat with wirbelscan-0.0.6

2010-12-04
 - add experimental output format libvlc xspl playlist. Thanks to Zouhair Souissi for libVLC m3u patch,

 - mplayer output format as suggested by Pedro A. Aranda
 - cosmetics

2010-05-29
 - bugfix: if compiled with DVB-API-5.x, but using DVB-API-3.2 @ DVB-S,
   IF was not assigned before tuning. Thanks to Juergen Lock.
 - added some descriptor id's
 - update Astra 1E/1G/3A

   see https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=513871 (reported by "Stephen" and Felix Kaechele)
 - changed struct tvct_channel to avoid gcc-4.4 warnings
 - is_nearly_same_frequency changed to allow 2MHz on sat; 500kHz otherwise

2009-01-01/2009-04-25
 - SYNTAX CHANGE:
   w_scan now needs (!) command switch -c for defining your country. use uppercase two letters
   for specifying your country, as defined by ISO 3166-1 use -c? for list:
		DE = Germany
		US = United States
		GB = United Kingdom
		FR = France
		...
 - restructured code

    or
    * scan these additional symbolrates (default: 6900 and 6875 only) 
        6111, 6250, 6790, 6811, 5900, 5000, 3450, 6950, 7000, 6952
   NOTE: expert settings, will slow down by a factor of up to 10.

			-l (LNB setting)
			-D (DiSEqC switch)
 - w_scan now shares the list of satellites with wirbelscan plugin (0.0.5 pre1 or higher)
 - removed folder patches (obsolet)
 
2008-11-06

2007-09-09
 - added kaffeine channels.dvb format, switch -k
2007-08-07
 - w_scan will no longer stop if frontend params cannot be set correctly.
   This is necessary, because newest mercurial dvb drivers seem to have sometimes
   difficulties with scanning complete frequency range. Additionally some cards added
   to pci.ids.
2006-09-03
 - added output format (dvb)scan initial-tuning-data
2006-09-01

	- airstar2 dvb-t
	- avertv avermedia 771 dvb-t
	(please report other working/non-working cards to me..)
