How to build packages
---------------------
For boxee: 
# ./make_debian.sh

For boxee-usplash:
# cd ../splash
# ./make_debian

For boxee-admin-tool:
# cd ../admin-tool
# ./make_debian

How to upload packages
----------------------
# cd ~/build/boxee/client/trunk
# ./upload_debian.sh <path of local .deb package>

It will do everything that needs to be done. It will prompt twice for the 
password of distro@apt.boxee.tv. It will not upload a package which already
exists there.

How to use
----------
To use the repository add the following line to /etc/apt/sources.list:

deb http://apt.boxee.tv gutsy main

Then:
# sudo apt-get update
# sudo apt-get install boxee boxee-artwork-usplash boxee-admin-tool
